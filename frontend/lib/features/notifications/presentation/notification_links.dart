/// A switch over the parsed type rather than over `data['kind']`, because the
/// type is the thing the API guarantees and the kind is a hint the client could
/// have to tolerate missing. Each destination is the screen that answers the
/// notification's own sentence:
///
/// - a new request is answered on the tutor's request list;
/// - a decline is answered by choosing somebody else, so it opens matching;
/// - a completed session asks the tutee to rate it, so it opens the rating form;
/// - a received rating is read on the session it belongs to, because that is
///   where the tutor's feedback lives;
/// - a promotion is the certificate screen, which is where standing pays off.
///
/// Null rather than a guess when the ids are absent. Sending a student to a
/// screen that cannot name the thing they tapped is worse than leaving them in
/// the inbox, which at least still shows the message.
